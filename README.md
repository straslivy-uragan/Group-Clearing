Group-Clearing
==============

Group Clearing is an Android app for storing
information about debts within a group of people and helping to clear
them out. Main purpose is to serve to a small group of people, such as
travelling together. In this situation you can often come across a
situation in which someone pays a check for other people. This
application helps to remember the debts which ocur in this way and
helps to clear them out later. As it is designed for travelling, one
of the features of this application is naturally a support for
multiple currencies (which has to be switched on in the settings).
